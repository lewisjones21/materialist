I made this game using Unity 5.1 in 2015.
It was created as part of the Gamers To Engineers project at the University of Cambridge Engineering Department,
which was integrated with the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (UROP).

I worked as part of a team of undergraduate engineers from the CU Engineering Department;
each of us developed our own game prototype every 2 weeks as part of a rapid-prototyping process.
Each cycle produced a set of 4 or 5 short games following a common theme, which we would decide at the start of each cycle.
We repeated this cycle 4 times (after a shorter onboarding cycle), producing 5 games each.

Here is the full list of games I produced in the series:
- [Materialist](https://github.com/lewisjones21/materialist)
- [Angular Momentor](https://github.com/lewisjones21/angular-momentor)
- [Something About Lasers](https://github.com/lewisjones21/something-about-lasers)
- [Drastic Statactics](https://github.com/lewisjones21/drastic-statactics)
- Shoot Some Ninjas (codebase unavailable)

A trailer for this game can be found [here](./Admin/Materialist%20Teaser.mp4).

The critique document produced as part of the review process for this game was not recovered along with the codebase,
but I personally feel that this game was easily the most succesful of those I produced during this project.
It exceeds the others in terms of gameplay, enjoyment, understandability, puzzle satisfaction, completeness,
and especially in terms of technological achievement.
